# Excel with yrXlsim

This sample Quarto book shows how to embed **yrXlsim** YAML in a document. Any fenced code block with the class `yrxlsim` is parsed and rendered as an Excel-like spreadsheet when the HTML is viewed in a browser.

## How to use

In your `.qmd` file, write a code block and add the `yrxlsim` class. The block below is a live example — it is rendered by JavaScript into the table you see:

```{.yrxlsim}
version: "0.0.2"
rows:
  - ["Label", "Value"]
  - ["Total", "=A2*2"]
```

The source for that table is the YAML above (in a block with class `yrxlsim`). The YAML must follow the [yrXlsim sheet format](https://github.com/...) (see YAML-SPEC-v0.0.2.md). The next chapter shows more examples.
